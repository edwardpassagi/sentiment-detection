# Sentiment Detection

This repository contains an implementation of **Sentiment Detecion** utilizing Unigram and Bigram approach. It is partly done as my university project, which I decided to continue and share with the world.

# Hosting

I'm planning to host this repository as a python web-application, which I'll be hosting at **Herokuapp**.
> This feature is still on the works.

## Running it Locally

Make sure you have the relevant python libraries before running this app:
 - [ ] flask
 - [ ] numpy
 
You can then call `python3 sentiment.py` from the local project root directory. Default port hosting should be at **5000**, and can be acessed locally at `localhost:5000`.
